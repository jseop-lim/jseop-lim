I am a master’s student in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University and a member of the Software Analysis Lab. My research goal is to make program analysis techniques practical for real-world software systems. Previously, I worked as a Python backend developer at a fintech startup, developing automated systems for loan and investment processes. In this role, I focused on software maintainability through robust architectural design, clear documentation, and sustainable engineering practices.
